Todo list:

Code development
- test 100% generate_vf
- test 100% fields.composition
- test 100% fields.composition
- test 100% fields.matrices and auxiliaries
- test 100% fields.matrices and auxiliaries
- test Jacobians
- test Lie brackets
- test transformations.linear

New features
- add log-composition
- Bossa Algorithm for the log function
- bump function,
- agents and facade for the design pattern
- well behaved homographies, with reasoned input and test
- add 3d homographies and special euclidean group (see rodriguez formula)
- add latex documentation with guided formulas and examples (independent from the code)
- time varying velocity fields (add 4d vector fields and related solver)
- Test 90%, then first release 1.0.0 here!!
