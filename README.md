# Vector Fields Tools

Started in 20-03-2016.
Python 2.7.1.
 

## Introduction

Hopefully light framework to manipulate, integrate, derivate and visualize vector fields.
In includes local operations from Lie group theory as Lie logarithm, exponential, log-composition, exp-sum and exp-multiplication by a scalar (see docs for definitions).
It is a light refactoring of the less flexible but more specific software proposed in the repository lie_exponential.

The main aim other than provide prototyping playground where to test algorithms of manipulations of vector fields.
